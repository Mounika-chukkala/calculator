# calculator
I had designed the calculator(basic) with basic functionalities using HTML,CSS,JavaScript
Designed using HTML,CSS,JS .
here I have given the display and basic structure of the calculator using the css .
Then I have given the event listeners to the buttons to perform different operations.
I stored the characters clicked by the users on claculator by the event listeners and appended it to the text until the user clicks =(equal to button).
When the user clicked the equal to button then it call the eval function on the text by correcting the symbols in the string.
Then it represents output on the screen using innerText function the expression element.
And we have performed slicing on the text we have as event Listener for the del button.
And for clr button I had made the text and expression's innerTExt to ("")Empty string.
And clear Button uses the toggle to dissapear the blinking line on the screen and text and expression innerText will be assigned to the empty Strings.
